This HTML5/CSS3 website project was individually created in the "Build Your Own Website in HTML" course during the second semester of the Web Design and Development program at Baruch College.

The main objective of the the project was to apply the set of general rules learned during the course. I used the HTML and CSS skills learned on it to create four web pages.
